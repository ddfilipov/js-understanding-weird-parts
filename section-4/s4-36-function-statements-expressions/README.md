# 36. Function Statements and Function Expressions

## Expression

An expression is a unit of code that results in a (creating a) value. It doesn't have to save to a variable.

Let's say we have this `var a`. And then we do this in the console: `a = 3`. When we do that, this returns a value. So it's an expression.
We can also do 1 + 2 in the console. And that would return a value too, even though we're not setting its result to any variable. So it's an expression too.
So we saw that expression means a line (or unit) of code that results in (creates) a value.

## Statement
A statement is also a unit of code, but it doesn't return a value. Let's see an example:

```js
if (a === 3){

}
```
That `if (a === 3)` is a statement. There's an expression inside of the if statement, but the statement itself is that, a statement, because doesn't return a value. We can't put that if statement in a `var`.

In JavaScript there's function statements and function expressions.
