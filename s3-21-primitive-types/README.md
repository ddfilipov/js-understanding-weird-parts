# 21. Primitive Types

Let's see what types of data exist in JavaScript, even though we dont say which ones they are in the variable declaration.

## Primitive types

It's a type of data that represents a single value. In other words, something that isn't

### undefined

Represents lack of existense, we shouldn't set a variable to this.

### null

Also represents lack of existance, you can set a variable to this.

### boolean

it's either true or false

### number

It's a floating point number, there's always some decimals attatched to it. In js there's just one numeric type, and it's `number`.

### string

a sequence of characters

### symbol

Used in ES6, not gonna talk about it on this course, yet.

**TLDR**: JavaScript has types even though you don't need to declare variables with those types. The js engine figures out the type of a variable on the fly.
