# 14. Conceptual Aside: Single Threaded, Synchronous Execution

`Single threaded` means that one command is executed at a time. We have to understand that when we say single threaded, js is not the only thing happening under the browser. But from our perspective as programmers, js behaves in a single threaded manner.

`Synchronous` is similar to single threaded, it means one at a time, and in the order as it appears on the code.

**TLDR**: Javascript is single threaded synchronous execution in its behaviour.
